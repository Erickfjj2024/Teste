# Mod API reference

The contract between Horizon and its mods: the WIT package `horizon:mods@0.1.0`, every interface, type, function and hook in it, and the capabilities a manifest may list. The guide is [mods.md](../mods.md); stability and versions: [stability.md](stability.md). Manifest `api` lines this game serves: `0.1`, `0.2`, `0.3`.

## World `horizon-mod`

A client mod: runs in the player's game.

| `write` | `func(level: level, message: string)` | One line in the game's log as `[mod <id>] message`, at that level. |

## `game`

Access: capability `game-read`.

Capability `game-read`: the local player, the world clock and the block the player looks at.

| `block` | `string` | `minecraft:stone`, ... |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get-player` | `func() -> option<player>` | None on the title screen. |
| `get-clock` | `func() -> option<clock>` | None on the title screen. |
| `raycast` | `func(distance: f32) -> option<hit>` | The first block along the player's view (fluids pass), up to `distance` blocks (at most 1024; past the loaded chunks, across the distant terrain when LOD Distance is on), as of this tick. None when nothing is hit, and on the title screen. |

## `chat`

Access: capability `chat`.

Capability `chat`: messages only the local player sees.

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `show` | `func(text: string)` | Shown in chat after the mod's name, like a system message. |

## `hud`

Access: capability `hud`.

Capability `hud`: one panel of text lines per mod, drawn by the game every frame until the mod changes or clears it (no call per frame).

### enum `corner`

| Case | |
| --- | --- |
| `top-left` |  |
| `top-right` |  |
| `bottom-left` |  |
| `bottom-right` |  |

### record `line`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `string` | Plain text, up to 256 characters. |
| `color` | `u32` | 0xRRGGBB. |

| `clear` | `func()` | Removes the mod's panel. |

## `storage`

Access: capability `storage`.

Capability `storage`: a per-mod folder of small key/value files, quota'd (docs/mods.md). Keys are `[a-z0-9_.-]{1,64}`, one path segment.

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get` | `func(key: string) -> option<list<u8>>` | None if `key` has never been `set`, or the key is not well-formed. |

| `delete` | `func(key: string)` | No error if `key` was already absent. |

## `command`

Access: capability `command`.

Capability `command`: vanilla commands run as the player, with the player's permissions, after the hook call returns (8 per call). A mod's own commands are not run this way.

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `func(line: string)` | `line` without its slash; its feedback goes to the chat as if typed. |
| `run-quiet` | `func(lines: list<string>)` | `lines` (each without its slash, at most 256 a call) as `run` does, but with nothing in the chat: no feedback and no failure. In single player and on Horizon's servers, each runs exactly as the player typing it would (the same rights), in order, 64 a tick, and the server logs one line a batch; one that carries a chat message (`say`, `msg`) is refused. On any other server they go as chat commands, and there their feedback shows: a mod running many should say so. |

## `ui`

Access: capability `ui`.

Capability `ui`: widgets the game draws with its own menus' widgets, for a screen the mod owns and a settings page in Options > Mods. Layout and drawing are the game's: a mod says what its widgets hold, never where they sit or how they look, and the game clips everything it is handed.

### record `text-widget`

A line of text.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `u32` | The mod's own name for the widget; `ui-events` calls echo it. |
| `text` | `string` | Up to 256 characters. |
| `color` | `u32` | 0xRRGGBB; 0 is the menus' white. |

### record `item-widget`

An item's icon and a name beside it, as recipe viewers show them.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `u32` | The mod's own name for the widget. |
| `item` | `string` | `minecraft:diamond`, `<mod>:<path>`; an unknown id draws a "?". |
| `name` | `string` | The name shown beside the icon (empty: the item's own). |

### record `list-widget`

Rows the player picks one of, as an options page lists choices: a pick is `ui-events::select`, `selected` is the row to mark now.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `u32` | The mod's own name for the widget; `ui-events::select` echoes it. |
| `rows` | `list<string>` | The rows' texts, at most 512, each up to 256 characters. |
| `selected` | `option<u32>` | The row to mark as the current choice, if any. |

### record `button-widget`

A thing on a mod's screen or settings page. A button as the options pages have them (200 × 20): a click is `ui-events::select(id, 0)`. Mods cycle its label for a choice ("Corner: Top Left").

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `u32` | The mod's own name for the widget. |
| `label` | `string` | Up to 256 characters. |

### variant `widget`

| Case | Payload | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `text-widget` | Text the player reads. |
| `button` | `button-widget` | A button. |
| `item` | `item-widget` | An item's icon and name. |
| `list` | `list-widget` | Rows the player picks from. |

### record `screen`

A screen the mod owns: a title over widgets stacked down the middle, the Done button the game adds, and Esc to leave it.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `string` | Its title, up to 256 characters. |
| `widgets` | `list<widget>` | Its widgets, in order, at most 64. |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open-screen` | `func(screen: screen)` | Show `screen` over the game; a second call while it is open replaces it. Only the last call of one hook counts. |
| `close-screen` | `func()` | Close the mod's screen when it is open (the mod hears no `closed` for this: it was its own doing). |
| `set-settings` | `func(widgets: list<widget>)` | The mod's page in Options > Mods, reached from a settings button on its row: the widgets it shows, an empty list for no page. The player opening the page is `ui-events::settings-opened`: push fresh widgets then; later calls update the page while it shows. |

## `ui-events`

Access: exported by the mod: the game calls it.

What the game calls on a mod that shows widgets (capability `ui`): what the player did with them.

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `select` | `func(id: u32, row: u32)` | A row of one of the mod's `list` widgets was picked: the widget's `id` and the row, on the screen or the settings page that showed it. |
| `closed` | `func()` | The player left the mod's screen (Esc or Done); not for a screen the mod closed itself or one that went away with the mod. |
| `settings-opened` | `func()` | The player opened the mod's settings page in Options > Mods: call `ui::set-settings` now to fill it with fresh widgets. |

## `input`

Access: capability `input`.

Capability `input` (experimental: the manifest needs `experimental = ["input"]`): the use button on items the mod claims, and the mod's own keys. Events wait for `poll`, at most 256.

### record `held-item`

The main hand's stack.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | `minecraft:spyglass`, `<mod>:<path>`. |
| `count` | `u32` |  |
| `slot` | `u32` | The hotbar slot, 0 to 8. |

### record `item-use`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item` | `held-item` |  |
| `ticks` | `u32` | Game ticks the button was held (0 on `use-start`). |

### variant `event`

| Case | Payload | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `use-start` | `item-use` | The use button went down with a claimed item in the main hand. The game does nothing else with the click: no placing, no eating, no swing. |
| `use-stop` | `item-use` | It came up again, or the item left the hand, or a screen opened. |
| `key-down` | `string` | A key `register-key` named went down or up while playing (no screen open). The game's own mapping on that key still runs. A screen opening lets every held key up. |
| `key-up` | `string` |  |
| `wheel` | `f32` | Mouse wheel steps while the mod holds the wheel (`claim-wheel`): positive away from the player, as the hotbar reads them. |

### record `mapping-state`

A mapping as the player has bound it.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | `string` | The bound key's name as Controls shows it: `W`, `Space`, `LMB`. |
| `down` | `bool` | Held down now (as of this frame for a mod with a `frame` hook, else this tick). |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claim-items` | `func(ids: list<string>)` | The items whose use the mod handles instead of the game, by id (at most 64). Replaces the previous list. |
| `register-key` | `func(name: string, label: string, key: string) -> result<_, string>` | A key of the mod's: `name` comes back in `key-down` and `key-up`, `label` says what it does, `key` is the key as options.txt writes it (`key.keyboard.r`), the default: the player can bind another one on the mod's page in Options > Mods, and that one wins. At most 16; an unknown key is an error. |
| `held` | `func() -> option<held-item>` | The main hand's stack, as of this tick; none when it is empty. |
| `poll` | `func() -> list<event>` | The events since the last call, oldest first. |
| `claim-wheel` | `func(on: bool)` | Takes the mouse wheel while playing (true) or gives it back: while taken, its steps are the mod's `wheel` events and the hotbar doesn't move. The game gives it back when the mod stops. |
| `mapping` | `func(name: string) -> option<mapping-state>` | A movement or click mapping as the player has bound it: `key.forward`, `key.left`, `key.back`, `key.right`, `key.jump`, `key.sneak`, `key.sprint`, `key.attack` or `key.use`. None for another name. |
| `clicks-per-second` | `func() -> tuple<u32, u32>` | Clicks of the attack and use buttons in the last second. |

## `render`

Access: capability `render`.

Capability `render` (experimental: the manifest needs `experimental = ["render"]`): shapes the game draws for the mod with its own renderer, kept until the mod replaces them (no call per frame). A mod never supplies shader code.

### enum `corner`

A corner of the screen, as `hud`'s panels use them.

| Case | |
| --- | --- |
| `top-left` |  |
| `top-right` |  |
| `bottom-left` |  |
| `bottom-right` |  |

### record `rect`

A rectangle in GUI pixels: the top left corner and the size.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | `f32` |  |
| `y` | `f32` |  |
| `w` | `f32` |  |
| `h` | `f32` |  |

### record `point`

A point in GUI pixels from the screen's top left.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | `f32` |  |

| `rect` | `rect` |  |
| `color` | `u32` | 0xAARRGGBB. |

### record `quad-shape`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `corners` | `tuple<point, point, point, point>` |  |
| `color` | `u32` | 0xAARRGGBB. |

### record `sprite-shape`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sprite` | `string` | One of the game's GUI sprites, as `gui/sprites/` names them (`hud/heart/full`, `widget/button`), the resource packs' versions included, drawn over `rect` as vanilla draws it: nine-sliced when its `gui.scaling` says so (`tooltip/frame`, `widget/button`: the borders keep their size), stretched otherwise. An unknown one draws nothing. |
| `rect` | `rect` |  |
| `color` | `u32` | A tint, 0xAARRGGBB: 0xFFFFFFFF draws it as it is. |

### record `item-shape`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item` | `string` | `minecraft:diamond`, `<mod>:<path>`; an unknown one draws nothing. |
| `at` | `point` | The icon's top left. |
| `scale` | `f32` | 1.0 is the hotbar's 16 × 16. |

### record `text-shape`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | `string` | Up to 256 characters, one line. |
| `at` | `point` |  |
| `color` | `u32` | 0xRRGGBB, as `hud`'s lines. |
| `centered` | `bool` | Centred on `at.x` instead of starting there. |
| `shadow` | `bool` |  |

### variant `shape`

| Case | Payload | |

| `item` | `item-shape` |  |
| `text` | `text-shape` |  |

### record `frame-rate`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fps` | `u32` | Frames drawn in the last second. |
| `min` | `u32` | The slowest frame's rate, and the 1% low (the 99th percentile frame time's rate), over the last 5 seconds. |
| `low` | `u32` |  |

### record `zoom`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `factor` | `f32` | The field of view is divided by it: 1 is none, at most 10. |
| `smooth` | `bool` | Ease in and out through the game's field-of-view easing, as the spyglass does, instead of at once. |
| `turn` | `f32` | Mouse turning is multiplied by it while zoomed: 1 keeps the player's sensitivity, at least 0.05. |

### record `minimap`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `corner` | `corner` |  |
| `size` | `f32` | Its side in GUI pixels, 16 to 256. |
| `blocks-per-pixel` | `f32` | World blocks per map pixel, 0.5 to 4; the map is 128 × 128 pixels. |
| `rotate` | `bool` | The map turns with the player, who faces up, and an N on its rim marks north. Otherwise north is up and the player's arrow turns. |
| `round` | `bool` | Round, the corners left clear; otherwise square. |

### record `far-terrain`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `distance` | `u32` | How far the distant terrain reaches, in chunks: 64 to 1024. On integrated graphics other than Apple's the game caps it lower. |
| `reduced` | `bool` | Coarser far tiles, as the Far Detail setting's Reduced: 2 to 4 ms less GPU time per frame on integrated graphics. |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set-hud` | `func(shapes: list<shape>)` | Replaces the mod's HUD shapes: up to 1024, drawn every frame in order over the HUD (after the hotbar, under chat and screens), hidden with the HUD (F1). An empty list removes them. |
| `gui-size` | `func() -> tuple<f32, f32>` | The screen's size in GUI pixels (width, height), as of this tick. |
| `shake` | `func(strength: f32, seconds: f32)` | Shakes the camera: a jolt of `strength` (0 to 1, 1 the hardest) that fades out over `seconds` (at most 10). Jolts add up to 1. The view turns, the player doesn't, and the player's Distortion Effects option scales it (0 turns it off). |
| `set-corner` | `func(corner: corner, width: f32, height: f32, shapes: list<shape>)` | Replaces the mod's corner panel: shapes in GUI pixels from the top left of a `width` × `height` box that the game places in `corner`, stacked with the game's overlays and the other mods' panels (under the status effects at the top right), as `hud`'s panels are. |
| `clear-corner` | `func()` | Removes the mod's corner panel. |
| `text-width` | `func(text: string) -> f32` | The width of one line of text in GUI pixels, in the HUD's font: exact for Latin letters (U+0000 to U+024F), 6 per other character. |
| `frame-stats` | `func() -> frame-rate` | The game's frame counter, recomputed twice a second. |
| `set-zoom` | `func(zoom: zoom)` | Zooms the camera until the next call (`factor` 1 ends it), only while playing: a screen opening or the spyglass's own view (which wins) leave the camera vanilla's. With several mods, the strongest zoom counts. |
| `set-minimap` | `func(minimap: option<minimap>)` | Shows a map of the world around the player in `corner`, stacked with the game's overlays and the mods' panels, until the next call (none hides it). It looks like a map item: vanilla's map colours with their height shading and water depth, and the player's arrow. Underground, under a roof and in the Nether it maps the floor around the player's height. The game keeps the map's tiles and refreshes them within its own frame budget; hidden, they are dropped. One map shows at a time: the first loaded mod's. |
| `set-far-terrain` | `func(far-terrain: option<far-terrain>)` | Draws the world beyond the render distance as distant terrain, out to `distance` chunks, until the next call (none ends it). The game builds it on its own workers, from the chunks already loaded or saved and, where nobody has been, from the world's generator; the simulation distance doesn't change. Only worlds whose generator the game has (single player and a LAN world you host) show it. The player's own LOD Distance setting, when on, wins. One far terrain shows at a time: the first loaded mod's. |

## `events`

Access: exported by the mod: the game calls it.

What the game calls. Only the hooks `init` asks for are ever called.

### record `registration`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commands` | `list<string>` | Chat commands, without the slash. A name vanilla already uses is refused (vanilla's command runs). |
| `tick` | `bool` | Call `tick` every game tick (20 per second while playing). |
| `frame` | `bool` | Call `frame` every rendered frame. Budget: 0.1 ms. |
| `chat` | `bool` | Call `chat` for each chat line the player receives. |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | `func() -> result<registration, string>` | Once, after loading. An error keeps the mod off and is shown. |
| `tick` | `func(tick: u64)` | Each game tick while in a world, with the game's tick counter. |
| `frame` | `func(seconds: f32)` | Each rendered frame, with the seconds since the last one. |
| `command` | `func(name: string, args: string) -> result<option<string>, string>` | `/name args`: ok(some(text)) is shown as feedback, err(text) in red. |
| `chat` | `func(text: string)` | Each chat line the player receives, as plain text. |

## `recipes`

Access: capability `recipes`.

Capability `recipes` (experimental): the recipes and items the game knows, for recipe viewers. In single player and on Horizon's servers they are the world's; on any other server they are vanilla 26.3's (a client is sent no others), while `known` follows that server's book.

### record `stack`

An item of `items`, by its index there, with a count and the components it has beyond the item's own, in vanilla's item syntax (`[potion_contents={potion:"minecraft:swiftness"}]`), or "".

| Field | Type | |

| `item` | `u32` |  |
| `count` | `u32` |  |
| `components` | `string` |  |

Refused while no such screen is open, for a recipe the player's book doesn't hold and for one that can't be placed; one missing items shows as a ghost in the grid, as in the book. |
| `give` | `func(stack: stack) -> result<_, string>` | Creative mode only: gives the player the stack, as taking it from the creative inventory does (`ServerboundSetCreativeModeSlot`): the selected slot first, then the hotbar, then the inventory.

| `get-biome` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32) -> option<string>` | The biome at a position (`minecraft:plains`, ...), as the server stores it (one per 4 x 4 x 4 cell): none where no chunk is loaded. |
| `get-environment` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32) -> option<environment>` | The sky and weather at a position, as of this call: none where no chunk is loaded. |
| `get-redstone` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32) -> u8` | The redstone signal reaching a block of the mod that carries a block entity, 0 to 15 (the strongest of the six neighbours, what a dispenser reads), as of the start of this tick: 0 for any other position. |
| `set-energy-capacity` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, capacity: u64) -> result<_, string>` | Sets how much energy a block entity of the mod holds at most, in place of its kind's `energy.capacity` (a machine whose upgrades raise it): 0 gives the kind's back. What it holds above the new capacity is lost. |
| `get-collision` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32) -> option<list<collision-box>>` | The collision boxes of the block at a position, as an entity bumps into them (an empty list for air, grass or a carpet's top: none): none where the server has no chunk loaded there. |
| `set-blocks` | `func(dimension: string, blocks: list<block-change>) -> result<_, string>` | Sets blocks as `/setblock` does: the old block entity removed, neighbours and shapes updated, light, and every player told. Every state is checked now (an error queues nothing); the changes are made in order after this call returns, before that dimension's next tick; one in a chunk not loaded then is skipped. At most 4096 per call. |
| `set-block-property` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, property: string, value: string) -> result<_, string>` | Sets one property of the block at a position (`lit`, `facing`) to a value, as a furnace's tick sets its `lit`: neighbours and players are told, and the block entity **stays** (a block set with `set-blocks` loses it). Made after this call returns, before the dimension's next tick; nothing happens for a block with no such property or value, or one already set. At most 4096 per call. |
| `set-item-faces` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, faces: list<list<u32>>) -> result<_, string>` | Sets which slots of the block entity's container each face reaches: the six lists are down, up, north, south, west, east, each of slot numbers (0 to 31). A hopper or dropper put through a face uses its list, as it would the kind's own `faces`, which this replaces for that one entity (kept with it). Made after this call returns; nothing happens for a block with no mod container. API 17. |
| `pull-items` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, face: u32, items: list<string>, max: u32) -> result<_, string>` | Pulls items out of the container beside the block entity, on its face `face` (0 to 5: down, up, north, south, west, east), into the block entity's own container through that same face: up to `max` items of the ids in `items` (any when empty), the ones the other container lets out through its side toward this block and this one lets in. Once, after this call returns; a Mekanism sorter calls it every few ticks. API 22. |
| `mine-block` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, tool: string, silk-touch: bool, to-x: s32, to-y: s32, to-z: s32, face: u32) -> result<_, string>` | Breaks the block at a position as a player with `tool` (an item id, say `minecraft:netherite_pickaxe`; with `silk-touch` it carries Silk Touch) would, rolls its drops, and puts them in the container at (`to-x`, `to-y`, `to-z`) through that block's face `face` (0 to 5: down, up, north, south, west, east); what does not fit drops where the block was. Nothing happens for air, liquids and unbreakable blocks. Once, after this call returns; at most 64 a call. API 23. |
| `set-item-eject` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, on: bool) -> result<_, string>` | Turns on or off the block entity pushing items out: every 10 ticks, from the slots of the kind's `outputs` that a face reaches, into the container beside that face (a chest, a hopper, another machine), as Mekanism's machines do with auto-eject on. Kept with the entity. Made after this call returns. API 17. |
| `set-tank-filter` | `func(dimension: string, x: s32, y: s32, z: s32, tank: u32, accepts: list<string>) -> result<_, string>` | Limits what the block entity's tank number `tank` takes in from neighbouring tanks and transmitters: only these substances (`mymod:oxygen`); an empty list takes any again (the kind's default). What the mod puts in the tank itself is not checked. Kept with the entity. Made after this call returns. API 18. |

## `player-control`

With the eye (the feet and 1.62 blocks, 1.27 sneaking) it gives the face of a block a use met. API 16. |
| `teleport` | `func(player: string, dimension: string, x: f64, y: f64, z: f64, yaw: option<f32>, pitch: option<f32>) -> result<_, string>` | Moves the player, as `/tp` does: the vehicle is left, velocity and fall distance reset. `yaw` and `pitch` stay as they are when none. The move is made after this call returns, before the next tick. An error (nothing queued) for a player not online, a dimension the server does not have, a position that is not finite or lies outside the world border of 30,000,000 blocks. |
| `take-xp` | `func(player: string, points: u32) -> result<_, string>` | Takes `points` experience points from the player, as vanilla's `Player.giveExperiencePoints(-points)` does, going down a level when the level's points run out; never below level 0.

## `recipe-types`

Access: capability `recipe-types`.

Capability `recipe-types`, server mods only (manifest `api = "0.3"`, experimental): the recipes of types the mod brings. A recipe file `data/<namespace>/recipe/<path>.json` whose `type` is outside `minecraft` is kept as it is written; the mod reads it as it likes, and asks the game which items an ingredient of it names (the game knows the item tags).

### record `custom-recipe`

| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | `<namespace>:<path>`, its place under `data/<namespace>/recipe/`. |

| `ingredient-items` | `func(ingredient: string) -> list<string>` | The items an ingredient names, in order, once each: `ingredient` is JSON, an item id, a `#tag`, a list of them, or an object with an `item`, a `tag` or `items`. A bare id is `minecraft:`; items the game doesn't know are left out. |

## `net`

Access: capability `net`.

Capability `net`, server mods only (manifest `api = "0.3"`, experimental): bytes between a mod's server half and its client half (`net-client`), on channels `<mod id>:<name>` (the mod's own id; the name is `[a-z0-9_./-]{1,64}`). At most 30000 bytes a message and 32 a player a tick; a player on a vanilla client gets nothing.

| Function | Signature | What it does |

## `net-events`

Access: exported by the mod: the game calls it.

What the game calls in a client mod that took `net-client`; a mod built before it has no such export and hears nothing.

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `func(channel: string, data: list<u8>)` | Bytes the server's half of the mod sent on `channel`. |

## `entities`

Access: capability `entities`.

Capability `entities`, server mods only (manifest `api = "0.3"`, experimental): the mobs and the other entities of the level the server is simulating. Reading is as of the last server tick. What a mod asks for is made after the call returns, before the next tick; a spawn answers with the new entity's id in `entity-spawned` the tick after (its `ticket` is what the call returned). An entity is named by its `dimension`: another level than the one in place is refused.

Returns a ticket as `spawn-mob` does. |
| `move-entity` | `func(dimension: string, id: u32, x: f64, y: f64, z: f64, yaw: f32, pitch: f32) -> result<_, string>` | Moves an entity Horizon keeps without simulating (a display, a marker, an interaction); a display eases there over its `teleport` ticks. |

Access: capability `chunks`.

Capability `chunks`, server mods only (manifest `api = "0.3"`, experimental): keeping chunks loaded (a chunk loader), and, with `chunk-loaded`, the hook a mod's world generation runs from.

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set-forced` | `func(dimension: string, chunk-x: s32, chunk-z: s32, forced: bool) -> result<_, string>` | Keeps the chunk (`chunk-x`, `chunk-z` in chunks) of `dimension` loaded and ticking even with no player near, or lets go of one the mod kept. The mod's own tickets only: it never lets go of a chunk a player forced with `/forceload`. At most 256 chunks a mod. Only the level the server is simulating takes it; the tickets are not saved, so the mod asks again when its blocks load. |

## `player-items`

Access: capability `player-items`.

Capability `player-items`, server mods only (manifest `api = "0.3"`, experimental): what players carry, and hurting them and giving them effects, for items with logic (a jetpack, a tablet that charges, armour with effects). Reading is as of the last server tick; what a mod asks for is made after the call returns, before the next tick.

### type `item-stack`

`type item-stack = item-stack`

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get-inventory` | `func(player: string) -> option<list<option<item-stack>>>` | The stacks a player carries as of the last tick: slots 0 to 35 are the inventory (0 to 8 the hotbar), 36 the feet, 37 the legs, 38 the chest, 39 the head and 40 the off hand; none for an empty slot. None for a player who isn't online. |
| `set-slot` | `func(player: string, slot: u32, stack: option<item-stack>) -> result<_, string>` | Puts a stack in a slot (none empties it); the player's client gets it. An error for a slot past 40, a player not online or a stack of an item the game doesn't know. |
| `hurt` | `func(player: string, damage-type: string, amount: f32) -> result<_, string>` | Hurts the player by `amount` of a damage type (`minecraft:magic`, `minecraft:fall`...), as vanilla's damage does (armour, absorption and invulnerable time count; creative players take none). |
| `add-effect` | `func(player: string, effect: string, duration-ticks: s32, amplifier: s32) -> result<_, string>` | Gives the player an effect (`minecraft:speed`, or a content mod's own `mymod:radiation`) for `duration-ticks` (-1 is infinite), at `amplifier` (0 is level I). |

## `server-events`

Access: exported by the mod: the game calls it.

What the server calls in a server mod (manifest `api = "0.3"`, experimental). Only the hooks `init` asks for are ever called. The player in each event is as the server saw them when it happened.

### type `player`

`type player = player`

### type `item-stack`

`type item-stack = item-stack`

### record `block-pos`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | `s32` |  |
| `y` | `s32` |  |
| `z` | `s32` |  |

### variant `argument-kind`

What an argument of a command takes. The server sends each command and its arguments to players' games, whose chat box completes and colours them as vanilla's; the server parses them before the mod's `command` hook gets their values.

| Case | Payload | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `word` |  | One word: letters, digits and `_ - . +`. |
| `text` |  | The rest of the line, spaces included: only last. |
| `integer` | `tuple<option<s32>, option<s32>>` | A whole number, within the bounds given. |
| `number` |  | A number with or without decimals. |
| `boolean` |  | `true` or `false`. |
| `player` |  | One online player: a name, or `@s` or `@p` (whoever typed it, as vanilla picks for a player). |
| `block-pos` |  | A block position: three whole numbers, each one also `~` or `~n`, relative to whoever typed it. |

### record `argument`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | Shown in the chat box's hint (`<height>`) and the key of its value. |
| `kind` | `argument-kind` |  |
| `optional` | `bool` | Optional arguments come after every required one. |

### record `server-command`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | Without the slash. A name vanilla already uses is refused (vanilla's command runs). |
| `arguments` | `list<argument>` | In order; none: the command takes nothing after its name. Free text is one optional `text` argument. |

### variant `argument-value`

An argument's value, parsed as its kind says.

| Case | Payload | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `word` | `string` |  |
| `text` | `string` |  |
| `integer` | `s32` |  |
| `number` | `f64` |  |
| `boolean` | `bool` |  |
| `player` | `player` |  |
| `block-pos` | `block-pos` |  |

### record `multiblock-spec`

A block of a multiblock group. The loaded blocks of one group that touch through faces make a structure candidate; the game tells the mod (`multiblock-changed`) whenever the candidates of a group in a dimension change: a block placed, broken or turned into another state. The mod decides whether a candidate is a real structure (a cuboid of the right size, with the right blocks, an empty inside it checks with `world.get-block`) and keeps the structure's shared state in the data, slots, energy and tanks of the member blocks it chooses.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `group` | `string` | The group's name (`mymod:turbine`); the mod's own. A block of several groups names them separated by commas. |

### record `multiblock-member`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pos` | `block-pos` |  |
| `state` | `string` |  |

### record `structure`

Touching blocks of a group: the members in position order and the least and greatest corner of the box around them.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `members` | `list<multiblock-member>` |  |
| `min` | `block-pos` |  |
| `max` | `block-pos` |  |

### variant `transmitter-medium`

What a transmitter block carries.

| Case | Payload | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `energy` |  | Energy: the blocks beside the network with an `energy-spec`. |
| `tank` | `string` | Substance of a tank `kind` (`fluid`, `gas`...): the blocks beside the network with a tank of that kind. |
| `items` |  | Items: the item slots of the blocks beside the network. Every ten ticks the game moves up to `throughput` items from the slots the mod blocks beside it let out (their `outputs`, through the face toward the network) into the containers beside it that take them (chests, hoppers, a block's `inputs`), shared round robin. |

### record `transmitter-spec`

A cable or a pipe. Transmitters of one medium that touch through faces both connect through make one network. Every tick, after the mods' `block-entities-tick`, the game moves from the blocks beside the network that give toward it (their face toward it is `output` or `both`) to those that take (`input` or `both`), shared evenly among them, at most `throughput` in all, and each block within its own rates (`max-extract`, `max-receive`, a tank's `max-rate`). A network's throughput is its least transmitter's.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `medium` | `transmitter-medium` |  |
| `throughput` | `u64` |  |

### record `tank`

What a tank holds: an empty substance is an empty tank.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `substance` | `string` |  |
| `amount` | `u64` |  |

### enum `flow-side`

Which way energy, fluid or a chemical may pass through a face of a block.

| Case | |
| --- | --- |
| `none` |  |
| `input` | Energy may flow in through this face. |
| `output` | Energy may flow out through this face. |
| `both` |  |

### record `tank-spec`

One tank of a block. A `kind` is a family of substances that mix with nothing outside it (`fluid`, `gas`, `infusion`...: the mod's own words); a tank holds one substance (`minecraft:water`, `mymod:hydrogen`) at a time, counted in whole units (millibuckets for a fluid). Every tick the game moves substance from each block's output faces into the tank of the block touching it that takes it in through the face that touches back, has the same kind, and is empty or holds the same substance; a tank gives and takes at most `max-rate` a tick.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `string` |  |
| `capacity` | `u64` |  |
| `max-rate` | `u64` |  |
| `faces` | `list<flow-side>` | The sides of the six faces: down, up, north, south, west, east. |

### record `energy-spec`

A block's energy store. The game moves energy every tick, after the mods' `block-entities-tick`, from each block's output faces to the block touching it, when that block takes energy in through the face that touches back. The unit is the mod's own (Mekanism's joules); the game only counts whole numbers. Each block gives at most `max-extract` and takes at most `max-receive` a tick, in all faces together.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capacity` | `u64` |  |
| `max-receive` | `u64` |  |
| `max-extract` | `u64` |  |
| `faces` | `list<flow-side>` | The faces' sides, in this order of faces: down, up, north, south, west, east. A block's mod may change them with `energy-faces` (a machine turned to face another way). |

### record `container-spec`

The slots of a block entity. Slot numbers start at 0; at most 256 slots.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `slots` | `u32` |  |
| `faces` | `list<list<u32>>` | The slots each face reaches, in this order of faces: down, up, north, south, west, east (what a hopper next to that face sees). |
| `inputs` | `list<u32>` | The slots hoppers may put into. |
| `outputs` | `list<u32>` | The slots hoppers may take from. |
| `menu` | `bool` | Using the block opens a menu with these slots, drawn as the content mod's menu type of the same id as the block describes (`data/<ns>/horizon/menu/<block>.json`, with as many slots). |

### record `block-entity-kind`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block` | `string` | The block's id, `mymod:machine`. |
| `ticks` | `bool` | Include this block's entities in `block-entities-tick`. |
| `container` | `option<container-spec>` | Item slots the block entity holds, as a vanilla container does (players, hoppers and droppers use them; a broken block drops them). None: no slots. |
| `energy` | `option<energy-spec>` | Stored energy, moved between neighbouring blocks by the game (see `energy-spec`). None: the block holds no energy. |
| `tanks` | `list<tank-spec>` | Tanks for fluids and chemicals, moved between neighbouring blocks by the game (see `tank-spec`). |
| `keep-data` | `bool` | The block keeps its entity's data in the item it drops: breaking it gives an item that carries the saved bytes, slots, energy and tanks, and placing that item gives them back (a machine that keeps its contents when picked up). The slots are then not spilled. |
| `transmitter` | `option<transmitter-spec>` | The block is a cable or a pipe (see `transmitter-spec`). None: not. |
| `multiblock` | `option<multiblock-spec>` | The block is a part of a multiblock structure (see `multiblock-spec`). |

### record `registration`

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commands` | `list<server-command>` | Commands players may type. |
| `tick` | `bool` | Call `tick` every server tick (20 per second). |
| `joins` | `bool` | Call `player-joined` and `player-left`. |
| `chat` | `bool` | Call `chat` for each chat message a player sends. |
| `blocks` | `bool` | Call `block-broken` and `block-placed`. |
| `block-entities` | `list<block-entity-kind>` | Blocks of the mod that carry a block entity: its saved bytes (`block-entity.data`), kept with the chunk and ticked by `block-entities-tick`. The block's content `template` must itself have a block entity (a furnace, a chest...), so that breaking the block removes it. |
| `net` | `bool` | Call `net-message` for what players' client halves send. |
| `items` | `bool` | Call `item-used` and `item-hit`. |
| `chunks` | `bool` | Call `chunk-loaded`. |

### record `block-entity`

A block entity of the mod, as the server holds it.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dimension` | `string` |  |
| `pos` | `block-pos` |  |
| `state` | `string` | The block state it sits in, `mymod:machine[facing=north]`. |
| `data` | `list<u8>` | What the mod saved last (empty for a new one): at most 65536 bytes. |
| `items` | `list<option<item-stack>>` | Its slots, as many as its container has (none for a block with no container). |
| `energy` | `u64` | The energy it stores (0 for a block with no energy), and the sides of its faces now. |
| `energy-faces` | `list<flow-side>` |  |
| `tanks` | `list<tank>` | Its tanks, in the order of its kind's `tanks`, and their faces' sides now. |
| `tank-faces` | `list<list<flow-side>>` |  |
| `menu-data` | `list<s32>` | The data slots its menu shows (progress, a mode), 16 bits each on the wire. |
| `transmitter-faces` | `list<bool>` | The faces a transmitter connects through now (down, up, north, south, west, east); empty for a block that is not one. |

### record `block-entity-update`

New bytes and slots for the block entity at `pos` in `dimension`.

| Field | Type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dimension` | `string` |  |
| `pos` | `block-pos` |  |
| `data` | `list<u8>` |  |
| `items` | `option<list<option<item-stack>>>` | The slots after the call; none leaves them as they are. Extra slots past the container's, and stacks of unknown items, are dropped. |
| `energy` | `option<u64>` | The energy after the call (kept within the capacity); none leaves it as it is. The game's transfers after the tick change it again. |
| `energy-faces` | `option<list<flow-side>>` | New sides for the faces; none leaves them as they are. |
| `tanks` | `option<list<tank>>` | The tanks after the call (kept within their capacities); none leaves them as they are. |
| `tank-faces` | `option<list<list<flow-side>>>` | New sides for each tank's faces; none leaves them as they are. |
| `menu-data` | `option<list<s32>>` | The menu's data slots after the call; none leaves them as they are. |
| `transmitter-faces` | `option<list<bool>>` | New connecting faces for a transmitter; none leaves them as they are. |

| Function | Signature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | `func() -> result<registration, string>` | Once, after loading. An error keeps the mod off and is logged. |
| `tick` | `func(tick: u64)` | Each server tick, with the server's tick counter. |
| `player-joined` | `func(player: player)` | A player joined the server; they are in `players.online` already. |
| `player-left` | `func(player: player)` | A player left the server; they are no longer in `players.online`. |
| `chat` | `func(player: player, text: string)` | A chat message a player sent, as plain text. |
| `command` | `func(player: player, name: string, args: string, values: list<tuple<string, argument-value>>) -> result<option<string>, string>` | `/name args` typed by `player`: ok(some(text)) is their feedback, err(text) their error in red. `values` holds each argument given, by name, in order (an optional one left out isn't there); a line that doesn't parse never reaches the mod: the player gets vanilla's error. |
| `block-broken` | `func(player: player, pos: block-pos, state: string)` | A player broke the block at `pos` in their dimension: `state` is what was there, as `minecraft:oak_log[axis=y]`. |
| `block-placed` | `func(player: player, pos: block-pos, state: string)` | A player placed `state` at `pos` in their dimension. |
| `block-entities-tick` | `func(tick: u64, entities: list<block-entity>) -> list<block-entity-update>` | Each server tick, for the loaded block entities of blocks `registration.block-entities` marked `ticks` (those of the level the server is simulating; at most 4096 a call, the rest wait their turn). Returns the entities whose bytes changed; the chunk is then saved with them. |
| `menu-button` | `func(player: player, dimension: string, pos: block-pos, id: s32, entity: block-entity) -> option<block-entity-update>` | A player pressed button `id` of the menu of the block entity at `pos` (a `button` widget of the menu type's screen), with the entity as it is. Returns what to change in it, if anything. |
| `net-message` | `func(player: player, channel: string, data: list<u8>)` | What `player`'s client half sent on `channel` (the mod's own), when `registration.net` is set. The bytes are the player's own: check them. |
| `multiblock-changed` | `func(group: string, dimension: string, structures: list<structure>) -> list<block-entity-update>` | The structure candidates of `group` in `dimension` changed (they are all of them, in the order of their least corner, empty when none is left). Called at the end of the tick, with the world lent, before the tick's transfers. Returns what to change in member blocks: updates for other blocks are dropped. |
| `entity-spawned` | `func(ticket: u64, id: option<u32>)` | The answer to a `spawn-mob` or `summon`: the new entity's id, or none when it could not be made (an unknown kind, a chunk not loaded, a monster on peaceful, a mod keeping it out). |
| `chunk-loaded` | `func(dimension: string, chunk-x: s32, chunk-z: s32, new: bool)` | A chunk came into the world (`registration.chunks`): `new` when it was just generated, false when it was read from the save. Its blocks are there (read them with `world.get-block`); what the mod changes with `world.set-blocks` is made at the end of the tick. This is where a mod adds its ores. The chunks around the spawn come before the first tick. |
| `item-used` | `func(player: player, stack: item-stack, pos: option<block-pos>) -> bool` | A player used `stack` (right click), in the air (no `pos`) or on the block at `pos`, when `registration.items` is set. Answer true to take the use: the hand swings and neither the item's own use nor the block's runs after it; false leaves it to the game. It is asked at the moment of the click, so what it asks for through imports is made at the end of the tick; `world.get-block` reads the blocks as they are now. |
| `item-hit` | `func(player: player, stack: item-stack, entity: u32, kind: string)` | A player hit the entity `entity` of `kind` holding `stack` (`registration.items`): where `Item.hurtEnemy` starts. It only hears. |
